          <p>We worked with Tom to improve our existing WordPress website. After being told by other companies that the website needed replacing, Tom took on the challenge to help us update it, improving the performance and fixing elements that had broken or never worked well. Tom was pro-active, professional and kept us informed at all times. Tom was transparent about what was and wasnâ€™t possible due to the age of the site and we have seen an immediate improvement in our website speed and performance. Working with Tom was very easy, and we will continue working with him on future projects.</p>

          <p>Developers need to be good communicators (most aren't). They need to be good planners and good timekeepers (most aren't). They need to listen and turn the project's creative vision into something that works in the real world. Tom has all of these qualities in spades and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him for any website project.</p>

          <p>Creating websites can be stressful, working with Tom is enjoyable throughout. The sites he builds are super fast, professional and pixel-perfect. Already, after two significant and successfully client-pleasing sites, Tom is my go-to Developer. I look forward to our next project.</p>
